Like any other activity, cooking requires a certain amount of equipment. Having
poor quality equipment will only serve to frustrate you, but dropping thousands
of dollars on carbon steel cookware and damascus knives isn't an option for most
people and is also very far over the point of diminishing returns in spending.

## Strictly Necessary Equipment

### Chef's Knife

{{% alert context="warning"%}}

A common mistake new cooks fall into is buying so-called "knife blocks." The
main selling point of these is that they contian all the knives you could ever
need, usually including a chef's knife, paring knife, filet knife, some steak
knives, etc.

Do not buy these. The knives in them are typically (but not universally) quite
low quality and you don't need all of those knives at the home cook level,
especially as a beginner. Spend that money on a single, good quality chef's
knife instead.

The chef's knife is by far your more important implement in the kitchen. To
defamiliarize slightly, most prep time in the kitchen is spent using a this
knife to turn things into more, smaller shapes. For this purpose, I have
recommended the
[Mercer Renaissance Chef's Knife](https://www.mercerculinary.com/product/renaissance-chefs-knife-10-25-4-cm/)
for a long time now. While it's not the cheapest knife on the market by any
means, it commands a modest price of around $60 from most retailers and has the
build quality to serve you for years to come without holding you back as your
skills improve like cheap floppy knives. My personal one has been going strong
for the better half of a decade by this point. A staple from home kitchens to
multi-starred restaurants, this knife will serve you indefinitely with
[basic care and regular sharpening](./knifecare).

I understand that $60 may be an offputting price to a lot of people with less
money to throw around. If that's too rich for your blood, here's some things to
keep in mind when shopping for a cheaper knife:

1. The blade should not flex or bend under pressure. A flexible blade makes a
   knife particularly dangerous while cutting things near your fingers.
2. The knife should be comfortable in your hand when held with proper technique.
   Lost wages and treatment because of carpal tunnel syndrome will be far more
   expensive than whatever you saved by buying a cheaper knife.
3. Perhaps counterintuitively, a sharp knife is a safe knife. Having to saw
   through material with a dull knife means you're putting more pressure into a
   blade that's moving around near your hand.
4. If possible, buy a forged knife instead of a stamped knife. Forged steel will
   be more durable, hold an edge better, and all around generally be a better
   knife.

### Cutting Board(s)

There is nothing more aggravating in day-to-day kitchen work than having a
cutting board that's too small. Ditch the tiny Ikea boards and head over to your
new best friend, [Webstaurant Store](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/). A
supplier for restaurants across the United States, they'll happily sell you a
high quality 24"x18" plastic cutting board in a wide variety of colors for $13
each. If you want to be really confident you'll never run out of cutting board
space again, get three and hit the bulk purchase discount while you're at it.
They're dishwasher safe and NSF listed, meaning they meet health, environment,
and safety standards for things like handling meat.

If you cook with meat, you should consider getting a separate color-coded
cutting board for it. Raw meat and cross-contamination between cooked food and
raw meat is the source of the majority of foodborne illness. If you get a red
cutting board for meat, raw meat should be the only thing to touch the red
cutting board and the red cutting board should be the only board to touch raw
meat.
