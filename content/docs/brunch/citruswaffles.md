Making waffles from scratch just to carry on into this recipe can be a lot of
work. If you don't have the motivation or equipment to make the waffles from
scratch with the other linked recipe this recipe will work fine with a boxed
waffle mix or, at the expense of texture and flavor, even a frozen toaster
waffle.

Remember, the food you actually eat is healthier than the theoretically better
food you didn't have the motivation to make.
