One night I was attempting to cook some tofu and rice and completely ruined my sauce. I didn't have the spare ingredients to start over, but my spouse made up this sauce on the spot and it ended up tasting really good.

You will likely have to go to a chinese grocer for some of the seasonings required for this, but I promise they're worth it.
